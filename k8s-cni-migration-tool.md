# Kubernetes CNI Migration Tool

## Project Relocated

The Kubernetes CNI Migration Tool has been moved to its own dedicated repository:

**[https://github.com/cmcconnell1/k8s-cni-migration-tool](https://github.com/cmcconnell1/k8s-cni-migration-tool)**

## About the Tool

The Kubernetes CNI Migration Tool is a comprehensive solution for assessing and facilitating migration from existing Kubernetes CNI solutions (Flannel, Calico, Weave, etc.) to Cilium.

### Key Features

- **Assessment**: Analyze your current CNI configuration and determine migration difficulty
- **Policy Translation**: Convert existing network policies to Cilium-compatible format
- **Migration Planning**: Generate a step-by-step migration plan based on your cluster's specific configuration
- **Validation**: Verify connectivity and policy enforcement before, during, and after migration

## Why It Was Moved

The tool has been moved to its own repository to:
- Provide better visibility and discoverability
- Enable independent versioning and releases
- Facilitate broader collaboration
- Streamline the development process
