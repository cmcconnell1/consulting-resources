- **Flannel**: Good scalability for medium-sized clusters but may face challenges in very large deployments.
- **Weave Net**: Reasonable scalability for medium-sized clusters, but the mesh approach can become a limitation in very large deployments.
- **Canal**: Similar scalability to Flannel, suitable for small to medium-sized clusters.

#### Resource Usage
- **Cilium**: Control plane has moderate resource requirements, but the data plane is very efficient due to eBPF.

- **Weave Net**: Moderate resource usage, with the mesh approach requiring more resources as the cluster grows.
- **Canal**: Combines the resource requirements of both Flannel and Calico components.

#### Performance Optimization Tips
- **Cilium**: Enable BPF NodePort for improved service performance, and consider using direct routing when possible.
